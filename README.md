# Project MailTK

I am practicing my C skills with this project.  It is an evolution from
(libmailcb)[github.com/cjungmann/libmailcb], which is, in turn, and
evolution from (mmcomm)[github.com/cjungmann/mmcomm].

I am playing with C-based generic objects and improving my coding
skills with respect to breaking out responsibilities into several
source files to improve code readability and maintainability.

The other goal with this project is to design an email library
that does as much of the heavy lifting as possible while offering
a flexible interface to allow easy customization according to
a project's needs.

## Funny Name

I can't remember what "TK" stands for.  It made some small amount of
sense when I dreamed it up.
